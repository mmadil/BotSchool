Learn to code 
====================

Coders Initiative.

Now coding is all fun with Bot School.

With it you can learn from the best documents all complied in a single
handbook.

**This handbook will be published as soon as I am done with my bots.**


Technologies used
====================

+ Raspberry Pi (as server)
+ IRCd (using UnrealIRCd)
+ Anope Services
+ python-espeak


Might add these later :

+ ZNC (IRC Bouncer)


Bots
====================

Bots manage most of the IRC activities themselves.
Different types of bots help us achieve the desired results.

Bots are of the follwing types :

+ Teacher - Manages the channel operations with some commands and reads the user documents provided in the handbook.
+ Speaker - This bot does not join an IRC, but teaches locally with text-to-speach translation.

Coming up next !
====================

+ A more comprehensive handbook.
+ Create a real IRC server and run Bot School on it.
